# Item List App

## Project Overview
This project is a simple cross-platform mobile application developed using **React Native**. The application allows users to view a list of items, add new items, and navigate between screens. It includes features for editing and deleting items, along with persistent data storage.

## Features

### App Structure
1. **Screen 1: List Screen**
   - Displays a list of items (e.g., names, to-do tasks).
   - Each item shows basic details (e.g., name, description).
   - Includes options to edit or delete items.

2. **Screen 2: Add Item Screen**
   - Allows users to add a new item to the list.
   - Users can input details such as:
     - **Name**
     - **Description**

### Data Handling
- **State Management**:
  - The app uses React state and context for efficient data handling.
  
- **Persistent Storage**:
  - The list of items is stored persistently using **React Async Storage** to ensure data is retained even after closing the app.

- **Input Validation**:
  - Ensures items have valid details before being added.
  - Provides user feedback for invalid input (e.g., empty name or description).

### Navigation
- Implements seamless navigation between the List Screen and Add Item Screen using **React Navigation**.

### Error Handling
- Prevents adding items with empty fields.
- Displays feedback for invalid actions.
